Dear Valued Survey Participant

<br/><br/>
Greetings,

"The Financial Market is a very emotional place that appeals to fear and greed" - Walter Schloss 
<br/>
Inspired with this quote, at Department of Management and Commerce, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Andhra Pradesh, India, we have set out with a goal to understand the role of psychological factors and its influence on an individual's financial decision making process. 
The study will uncover the hidden relationships between inherent behavioural nature and financial performance of individuals. It aims to use the discovered knowledge to improve financial decision making. 
To help achieve this goal, we are conducting an online survey coupled with a virtual stock market decision making exercise to gain important insights and feedback from individual stock market investors and active finance personnel. 
<br/><ol><li>
This study will require you to answer survey questions and participate in a simulated stock market scenario. It should take a maximum of 15 minutes for you to successfully complete the entire exercise.
</li><br/><li>
After each section is completed, you will be required to click on the NEXT button to proceed to the next section.
</li><br/><li>
The survey questions in the self-reported questionnaire are simple and self-explanatory and the instructions to the stock market exercise will be provided after completing the survey.   
</li><br/><li>
At the end of the stock market simulation, you need to click on the SAVE button. 
</ol>
<br/>
Your responses are highly valuable and the confidentiality will be maintained. The data obtained will be used only for academic purposes.
